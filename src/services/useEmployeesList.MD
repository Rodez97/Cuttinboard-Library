Here's what the above function is doing:

1. It's using the `useCollectionData` hook to get the employees from the database.
2. It's creating a `getEmployeeById` function that will return the employee with the given id.
3. It's creating a `EmployeesContext` with the employees, the `getEmployeeById` function, the loading state and the error state.
4. It's returning the `EmployeesContext` with the children.

Now, let's use the `EmployeesProvider` in the `EmployeesPage` component:

```jsx
import { EmployeesProvider } from "./EmployeesProvider";

export const EmployeesPage = () => {
  return (
    <EmployeesProvider>
      <EmployeesList />
    </EmployeesProvider>
  );
};
```

Now, let's use the `EmployeesContext` in the `EmployeesList` component:

```jsx
import { EmployeesContext } from "./EmployeesProvider";

export const EmployeesList = () => {
  const { getEmployees, loading, error } = useContext(EmployeesContext);

  if (loading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  if (error) {
    return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;
  }

  return (
    <ul>
      {getEmployees.map((employee) => (
        <li key={employee.id}>
          <Link to={`/employees/${employee.id}`}>{employee.name}</Link>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};
```

Here's what the above component is doing:

1. It's using the `EmployeesContext` to get the employees, the loading state and the error state.
2. It's displaying a loading message if the data is loading.
3. It's displaying an error message if there's an error.
4. It's displaying a list of employees.

Now, let's use the `EmployeesContext` in the `EmployeePage` component:

```jsx
import { EmployeesContext } from "./EmployeesProvider";

export const EmployeePage = () => {
  const { getEmployeeById } = useContext(EmployeesContext);
  const { id } = useParams();
  const employee = getEmployeeById(id);

  if (!employee) {
    return <div>Employee not
```
